= Sets
A set is an unordered collection of objects without repetition

Sets can be described by their members (elements)

Example: ${1,3,5,7}$

An ellipsis can be used to subject

Infinite Set : ${1,3,5,7,...}$

When $S$ is a set and $X$ is a member of $S$, we can write $X in S$ to indicate that $X$ is a member of $S$

$y #notin S$ means that $y$ is #strong[not] a member of $S$

$3 in {1,2,3}$

$9 #notin {1,2,3}$
